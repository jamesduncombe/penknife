So...

I don't know about you guys but I use a few tools a lot: Password Generator, Colour Picker, Ruler etc.
I was thinking, wouldn't it be REALLY handy if we had a little bookmarklet that we could launch on sites and 
carry out these things? Sure, there are extensions / plugins for different browsers but there's nothing that
I've found that actually brings these things together, especially cross browser.

Being a bookmarklet we can run it on different browsers, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari and even IE (9 and later).

Also, I'm trying to make it as moduler as possible so people can come along and add tools they want to it.
