So...

I was thinking. Us web designers / developers use a few basic things a lot: Password Generator, Colour Picker, Ruler etc. Wouldn't it be REALLY handy if we had a little bookmarklet that we could launch on sites and carry out these things?

Being a bookmarklet we can run it on different browsers, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari and even IE (9 and later).

Also, I'm trying to make it as moduler as possible so people can come along and add tools they want to it.
